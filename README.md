# my_silly_scripts

I'm going to upload the little scripts I made to practice and also that I applied to my data (when I couldn't find a "professional" solution online).

So I want to point out that I'm sure there are better ways to do it, but I leave my (silly) scripts just in case they would be helpful for someone. Watch out! There could be errors!

And, of course, if you have knowledge about scripting, any suggestion or comments will be grateful.
